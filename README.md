About me
-------

A spirited junior developer with a background in professional design and IT, I am excited to continue my tech industry journey! I look forward to working in an agile team, applying my strengths and learning from others to grow my front-end and back-end development capabilities.

Trained as a Freelance Artist, I intend to utilise my natural attention to detail, creativity and experience with clients to use in coding and consultation. Throughout my time as a Claims Manager and in Tech Support, I have thoroughly enjoyed working with others and supporting those around me, along with the challenge of solving problems with clientele and software.

As a [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/about-us/) graduate, I produce polished, test-driven, DRY code. I am currently continuing my study of these principles by completing the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

General Skills
-------

***Supportive Team-player***<br>
I genuinely enjoy working with others; camaraderie and support are always great motivators for creating high-quality projects. The Makers course led us to work on individual and joint projects, and I was comfortable with either arrangement. One of my strengths is ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to put forward their ideas so that we identify the best solution most effectively. 

This came into play during our [Makers Final Project](https://github.com/rupertpople/seedle), where I encouraged other quieter members to offer their thoughts and present my own. I also solidified my skills by either providing leadership or encouraging and supporting others who lead, depending on the team's needs.

My previous experience working within a tech team has been beneficial, too; it was imperative that I could mediate between our team members to communicate all requests and technical issues.


***Creative***<br>
My art background is excellent and gave me an eye for front-end design and even structuring code in a readable fashion. This skill has also allowed me to make or edit assets if needed, understand copyright, and design stylish modern web apps. Knowing how to use a given space was critical throughout my education and working within the art industry, which also applies well to the software industry for UX/UI design and code refactoring. 


***Problem-solver***<br>
Out-of-the-box thinking has always come to me naturally and has been an aspect of work that I find incredibly fun and satisfying. I navigated a large UK-wide company to resolve customer complaints; I constantly edited commission-based changes per client requests. My work as a CMS developer involved understanding and solving system errors frequently occurring, working around software that was in place for many years and changed by multiple developers. 

The Makers Academy Software Development course solidified my confidence with this skill by constantly pushing challenges that tested technical and logical thinking; I continuously commit similar challenges on [Github](https://github.com/Coral-Ann?tab=repositories).


***Self-motivated***<br>
Now that I am developing and maintaining software, my enthusiasm is boundless. I am eager to learn as much as possible and continue improving as a developer. I am excited to work on new challenges, gain new knowledge and use my existing skills to enhance my future projects.

I am continuing my personal development through the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), and I plan to use React JS to build a new art portfolio. I love that there is always something to learn within the software industry, as long as you have the motivation to do so.


***Communicator***<br>
As a freelance designer, I had to build strong relationships with my clients and understand their needs. This skill relates well to a consultancy role where I will also need to develop similar relationships with clients; however, instead of creating art, I will be coding for them.

I have clear written and vocal communication skills; I recommend watching our demo day presentation of Seedle below to see this in action (David and I are speaking). Much of my early education was based on performing arts, which has proven an invaluable source of confidence and clarity for presentations and discussions.

Hobbies
-------

**Art**  
Whilst I no longer work as a Freelance Artist, I continue designing in my spare time. My preferred mediums are usually digital or watercolours, and I love to build my skills by dabbling with different mediums. You can look at some samples of my work [here](https://www.coralbakerart.com); I'm replacing this with my website soon!

**Kayaking**  
Growing up on the Isle of Man meant I had constant water sporting opportunities, my choice always being kayaking. When able, I always jump at the chance to spend time on the water, having recently been in the lake district doing just that.

**Gaming**  
I love a range of games for their masterful story-telling and fun mechanics, and for me is a great team activity that involves constant puzzles and quick thinking. Here are some of my all-time favourites:
- Bioshock
- Red Dead Redemption
- Baldur's Gate
- Portal
- Final Fantasy XIV
- World of Warcraft
