About me
-------

A spirited junior developer with a background in professional design and IT, I am excited to continue my tech industry journey! I am looking forward to working in an agile team, applying my strengths and learning from others to grow my front-end and back-end development capabilities.

Trained as a Freelance Artist, I intend to use my natural attention to detail, creativity and experience with clients to use towards coding and consultation. Throughout my time as a Claims Manager and in Tech Support I have thoroughly enjoyed working with others and supporting those around me, along with the challenge of solving problems both with clientele and software.

As a [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/about-us/) student, I produce polished, test-driven, DRY code. I cannot wait to contribute to a range of future projects, my next personal project being a clean gallery website.

**Technical problem-solving**<br>
My work as a CMS developer (and prior as IT support) involved constant technical problem solving.

**Team-player**<br>
I thoroughly enjoy working with others, camaraderie and support are always great motivators for creating high-quality work.

**Creative**<br>
Having an art background is great for both having an eye for front-end design and out-of-the-box thinking with errors and bugs.

**Agile**<br>
I can confidently say that Makers Academy has taught me to be open to new tech stacks and work in different ways, which makes me adaptable and flexible within working environments.

**Self-motivated**<br>
Now that I’ve started my learning and development with coding, my enthusiasm doesn’t seem to stop growing. I’m eager to learn as much as I can and continually improve as a developer.

**Communicator**<br>
I have clear written and vocal communication skills, I recommend watching our demo day presentation of Seedle [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnX0ePaLG-I&t=863s) to see this in action!

**Travel**<br>
Having family up and down the country, I’m no stranger to travel and have a clean UK Driving License.
