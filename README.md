I am an aspiring developer with a background in design and IT, which has given me a combination of creativity and confidence working with others. Having completed my course as a [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/about-us/) student, I have been taught to produce polished, test-driven code in a variety of projects.

This journey has been incredibly fun and satisfying, I’m excited to continue to learn and grow with both Front-End and Back-End development.

Skills

**Languages & software**<br>
Ruby, Javascript, React, Adobe suite (photoshop, illustrator etc), be sure to take a look at my projects for full lists!

**Technical problem-solving**<br>
My work as a CMS developer (and prior as IT support) involved constant technical problem solving.

**Team-player**<br>
I thoroughly enjoy working with others, camaraderie and support are always great motivators for creating high-quality work.

**Creative**<br>
Having an art background is great for both having an eye for front-end design and out-of-the-box thinking with errors and bugs.

**Agile**<br>
I can confidently say that Makers Academy has taught me to be open to new tech stacks and work in different ways, which makes me adaptable and flexible within working environments.

**Self-motivated**<br>
Now that I’ve started my learning and development with coding, my enthusiasm doesn’t seem to stop growing. I’m eager to learn as much as I can and continually improve as a developer.

**Communicator**<br>
I have clear written and vocal communication skills, I recommend watching our demo day presentation of Seedle [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnX0ePaLG-I&t=863s) to see this in action!

**Travel**<br>
Having family up and down the country, I’m no stranger to travel and have a clean UK Driving License.
